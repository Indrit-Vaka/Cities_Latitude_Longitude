# Here are all files for processed cities.
## [Final File](cities.csv)
I have used the [CityList](../cities.csv) and got the latitude and 
longitude form [nominatim API](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/)

**Note:** Not all the cities are supported by this API.
We have collected all unsupported cities, you can find them here [UnsupportedCities](notSupported_cities.csv)
